                <small class="mbr-section-subtitle">Introduction<br>	Since Educational Technology relies on a broad definition of the word “technology”.  It is necessary therefore to look into the role of technology in education before examine the role of educational technology in the teaching and learning process.<br>	In Educational technology, technology is used to solve educational problems. The problem comes first, technology follows as a possible solution to the problems.  Let us examine some educational problems and how technology has been used or can be used to solve them.<br>	For instance, in the case/problem of increased enrollments, technology as been used to solve this problem with use of television broadcast and closed-circuit television.  In terms of administrative functions, computers have been found useful in keeping records, taking attendances, scoring, etc.  Technology may also be used to solve the problem of individual differences of learning during teaching and learning processes.  This can be achieved making instruction available in various formats for students thereby enable students to learn at their own rate and make learning individual.<br><br><br><strong>Roles of Educational Technology in Teaching and Learning Process</strong><br>	Educational technology principles when properly integrated into the teaching-learning situation in the classroom will:<br>-	Supply a concrete basis for conceptual thinking and hence reduce meaningless responses of students.<br>-	Provide a high degree of interest for students.  That is, if educational technology is correctly applied in the school system, it will arouse a new interest among the student, possibly, influence, if not changed attitudes towards both the teacher and his subject and even the teacher’s work will definitely be more interesting.<br>-	Supply the necessary basis for developmental learning and hence make learning more permanent.<br>-	Bridge the gap between the school and the outside world e.g. Television and Radio can bring immediacy to classroom.<br>-	Give instruction more scientific base<br>-	Provide opportunities for democratizing education. That is, providing opportunity for equal access to education.<br>-	Provide opportunity for total learning.<br>-	Make education more productive<br>-	Make education more individual<br>-	Communicate instructional content to students in much better way. <br>Other areas where educational technology has been found necessary in teaching and learning processes according to Salawu, Taiwo and Aremu (1994) are as stated below:<br>	It helps to store information and to make them easily accessible through Books, Radio, Television, Video-Cassettes, Audio tapes etc<br>	It helps to develop an awareness of problems, open up possibilities for exploration, present meaningful preliminary information, open up awareness to new activity and systematically provide solutions.<br>	It helps the child to focus his entire attention during teaching/learning process.  This is because he cannot successfully look at a motion picture, examine an object, operate a working model or use a computer and think about something else, at the same time.<br>	It helps to overcome physical limitations of presenting subject matter.<br>	It provides the teacher with a kit of tools to carry out diagnostic, research, and remedial work demanded by up-to-date instructional purposes.<br>	It provides the teacher with the means of guiding and controlling the desirable responses of the learner in relation to stimulus materials of the learning situation.<br>	It can be used to communicate directly and effectively with learners who have minimal reading skills:  Concepts that may be inaccessible to a student through reading may be conveyed to the learner by the combination of words and pictures.<br>	It can be used to teach or evaluate analytical skills and abilities in learner through the film.<br>Having examined the role of educational technology in teaching and learning processes, why do prospective teachers need to study this course. The answers to this question will be provided in the preceding paragraphs.<br>	Educational technology also known as learning technology (wikipedia 2008) as a course of study in teacher education programme according to Ogunlade (2005) include the following:<br>1.	Study of educational technology by prospective teachers will equip them proper way of handling classroom situation.<br>2.	The study of educational technology will enable teacher in training to have knowledge of how to find solution to all aspects of human learning.<br>3.	Educational technology will enable student-teachers to identify problems, finding solution to problem and evaluate the solution to the problem.<br>4.	Students of education need to study educational technology in other to have experience needed to meet challenges of present day instructional needs for all those engaged in teaching in an organization.<br>5.	The study of educational technology will enable teachers in training to know the principles and procedures in the filed that are necessary for growth in learning.<br>6.	Educational technology will equip student-teachers knowledge and skills that are necessary in improvising materials for teaching and learning.<br>7.	The study of educational technology will enable the student-teachers to know educational materials, their uses, strengths and weaknesses.<br>8.	Educational technology will develop in student-teachers how to operate equipment for teaching and learning processes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></small>
